This is a project I'm making to study Python and RESTful APIs, and directly involves both Twitter and Spotify API.

For now it only reads a given Twitter username, queries for all tweets that contain a Spotify URL, gets their IDs and lists the songs.

In the future, I want to implement account connection so the bot can add playlists to your Spotify account with the musics that you (or someone you may be curious about) tweeted in the last week.

If you want to use it, you WILL need (for now):
-Twitter OAuth2 Bearer Token
-Spotify Client ID (and secret, naturally)
